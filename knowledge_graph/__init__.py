"""Knowledge graph building utilities (mock + real pipelines).

This package is owned by DeFan and is intended to generate:
1) an enriched full park+policy knowledge graph (nodes/edges)
2) a policy subset JSON compatible with PolicyKnowledgeGraphAgent

Nothing in this package is required by the MVP pipeline unless you call it.
